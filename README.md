Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4 part 1 felt like the first time we write code without being able to visualize all of it due to how big it felt at the time. 
It was a fun lab that showed me how complex math can be split into sections of code, 
looking back that was some of the simpler math we had to put together in this class and thus it was an easy fun lab.


Lab 8 part 1 was the first time we use the if else statements. 
I really enjoyed learning that concept, it has many creative ways of use. 
Also this lab was where we were first introduced to the command line, and so it was difficult in the beginning but still a lot of fun.


Lab 11 was the most difficult lab. 
We had to write code to read from the file and we made our first constructor, 
again it eventually turned out to be fun. But in the beginning it got a little hectic because it had a few new concepts, 
but once we understood them, it turned out fun.
